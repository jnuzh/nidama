# A typical template description file includes the following
# other detailed descriptions:

# One for each language "family" (markup:html, css, client-side:js,
# server-side: php)

# Transitions out of and back to markup(html) for each of the
# other language types.

# So this four-family template language needs 10 modules: 
# 4 sublanguages, 3 html=>x, and 3 x=>html

# keep in mind that the transition modules need to go before the
# main language modules.  This is because the lexer will attempt
# tests in the order they're given, and we want to attempt
# inter-language tests first.

# Implementation note:
# The inter-family transitions will reference pattern variables
# that are defined in the main module for each family.

# Bug 94167: <script language="php"... => php script mode
# so html2php.udl needs to precede the others.
