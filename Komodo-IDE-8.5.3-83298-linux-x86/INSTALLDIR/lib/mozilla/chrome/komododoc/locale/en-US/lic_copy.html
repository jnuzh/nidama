ActiveState Komodo IDE License Agreement

Please read carefully: THIS IS A LICENSE AND NOT AN AGREEMENT FOR SALE. By using
and installing ActiveState's Software or, where applicable, choosing the "I
ACCEPT..." option at the end of the License you indicate that you have read,
understood, and accepted the terms and conditions of the License. IF YOU DO NOT
AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL THE
SOFTWARE. If the Software is already downloaded or installed, you should
promptly cease using the Software in any manner and destroy all copies of the
Software in your possession. You, the user, assume all responsibility for the
selection of the Software to achieve your intended results and for the
installation, use and results obtained from the Software. If you have any
questions concerning this, you may contact ActiveState via
license@activestate.com.

This ActiveState License ("License") is made between ActiveState ("ActiveState")
as licensor, and you, as licensee, as of the date of your use of the Software
(the Software is in use on a computer when it is loaded into the RAM or
installed into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk or other storage device) of
that computer.).

This License reflects ActiveState's intent to retain full ownership of and
control of the use and distribution of ActiveState Komodo, the License Key (as
hereinafter defined) and other applicable software (collectively the
"Software").

1. License Grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, ActiveState grants to you a
personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and limited license to use the
Software solely to create, compile, test and deploy, in source or object code
form, your own application programs ("Works"). You may create redistributable
applications based on your unique development work using the Software and you
may sublicense to end users of such Works ("End Users") the personal,
non-exclusive, non-transferable right to install and execute the files, and/or
libraries that are necessary to use the Works created using the Software. Use of
such files and/or libraries by such End Users is limited to runtime purposes
only. You may not provide any End User with access to the development or
interactive capabilities of the Software libraries or technology, nor may you
expose the base programming language(s) as a scripting language within the Works
to any such End User. When you pay the license fee established by ActiveState,
you will receive a license key (the "License Key") from ActiveState that
authorizes you to use the Software only in the following specific contexts.

  a. Commercial Use. If your License Key authorizes Commercial Use, you may use
  the software on more than one computer or on a network so long as you are the
  sole user of the Software. (A "network" is any combination of two or more
  computers that are electronically linked and capable of sharing the use of a
  single software program.) You will obtain a separate license for each
  additional user of the Software (whether or not such users are connected on a
  network). You are not permitted to sell, lease, distribute, transfer,
  sublicense, or otherwise dispose of the Software, in whole or in part, for any
  form of actual or potential commercial gain or consideration.

  b. Evaluation (Trial) Use. If your License Key authorizes Evaluation (Trial)
  Use, you may use the software only for evaluation purposes without payment of
  the License Fee for a period of no more than twenty-one (21) days from the
  date of download.

  c. Non-commercial Use. If your License Key authorizes Non-commercial Use, you
  may use the software in a teaching or learning environment only. You are not
  permitted to sell, lease, distribute, transfer, sublicense, or otherwise
  dispose of the Software, in whole or in part, for any form of actual or
  potential commercial gain or consideration.

  d. Application Service Provision. Any use of the Software in conjunction with
  ActiveState web services and any updates to such services which may be
  provided by ActiveState from time to time (the "Service"). ActiveState hereby
  grants to Licensee only the non-exclusive right and license to access, use,
  and transmit Licensee data with the Service. Licensee shall access the Service
  only with procedures communicated by ActiveState and use the Service only for
  Licensee's internal business operations including affiliated entities that
  control, or are controlled by, Licensee, and Licensee shall not permit the
  Service to be used by or for the benefit of third parties. Licensee shall not
  have the right to sublicense or sell rights to access or use the Service or to
  transfer or assign rights to access or use the Service, except as expressly
  provided herein. All rights not expressly granted to Licensee herein are
  expressly reserved by ActiveState.

  e. Other Use. Any use of the software other than the uses specified above
  requires a separate license from ActiveState and the payment of additional
  license fees as determined by ActiveState. Such additional redistribution
  options are available, at ActiveState's sole discretion, on a case-by-case
  basis. Contact Sales@ActiveState.com to discuss any redistribution options
  not covered by this license agreement. ActiveState reserves all rights not
  expressly granted to you herein.

  f. Student License. Student Edition Software means full versions of
  ActiveState Software, offered with special pricing and license terms, and only
  available to Qualified Student Users.

    1. Student Edition Special License Terms. Student Edition Software is not
    transferable. Student software is not version upgradeable. Commercial use is
    permitted only if the User is: a Qualified Student User at the time of
    purchasing the Software, a Qualified Student User at the time of development
    of Works and a Qualified Student User at the time of sublicensing of the
    Works.

    2. Please refer to the ActiveState student license requirements or contact
    ActiveState for further information on what is a "Qualified Student User,"
    and about other licensing options that may be available.

3. Termination.
This License Agreement is effective until terminated. ActiveState may terminate
this License immediately and without prior notice if you breach any term of this
License or for any other commercially reasonable ground. In the event of any
termination or expiration, you agree to immediately destroy and/or erase the
original and all copies of the Software, any accompanying documentation and
License Keys and to discontinue their use and you will not retain or store the
Software or any copies thereof, in any form or medium.

necessary to establish rights or enforce obligations under this Agreement, but
only to the extent that any such disclosure is necessary.
