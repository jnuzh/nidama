#        of files open in changelist 'default'.  Files may be deleted from
#        this list but they cannot be added.  (Use an open command (edit,

#    sync -- Synchronize the client with its view of the depot
#
#    p4 sync [ -f -n ] [ file[revRange] ... ]
#
#        Sync updates the client workspace to reflect its current view (if
#        it has changed) and the current contents of the depot (if it has
#        changed).  The client view is used to map client file names to
#        depot file names and vice versa.
#
#        Sync adds files that are in the client view but which have not been
#        retrieved before.  Sync deletes previously retrieved files which
#        are no longer in the client view or have been deleted from the
#        depot.  Sync updates files which are still in the client view and
#        which have been updated in the depot.
#
#        Normally, sync affects all files in the client workspace.  If file
#        arguments are given, sync limits its operation to those files.
#        The file arguments may contain wildcards.
#
#        If the file argument includes a revision specifier, then the given
#        revision is retrieved.  Normally, the head revision is retrieved.
#        See 'p4 help revisions' for help specifying revisions.
#
#        If the file argument includes a revision range specification, then
#        only files selected by the revision range are updated, and the
#        highest revision in the range is used.
#
#        Normally, sync will not clobber files in the client workspace that
#        the user has made writable.  Setting the 'clobber' option in the
#        client spec disables this safety check.
#
#        The -f flag forces resynchronization even if the client already
#        has the file, and clobbers writable files.  This flag doesn't affect
#        open files.
