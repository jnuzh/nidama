node-dbgp development and publishing
====================================

npm
---
The node.js remote debugging bits are published on the npm registry at http://search.npmjs.org/#/komodo-debug (http://registry.npmjs.org/komodo-debug for metadata).

.npmignore
-----------
The .npminclude file contains globs for all files that should not be published publicly with the npm package. Please make sure you are using a recent version of npm  when publishing a new release on the npm registry.

----------------------------------------
* Ask ToddW or MartinK for npm credentials if you need them.
