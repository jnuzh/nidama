# Default file types understood by "contenttype.py".
#
# Format is an extension of 'mime.types' file syntax.
#   - '#' indicates a comment to the end of the line.
#   - a line is:
#       <filetype> [<pattern>...]
#     where,
#       <filetype>'s are equivalent in spirit to the names used in the Windows
#           registry in HKCR, but some of those names suck or are inconsistent;
#           and
#       <pattern> is a suffix (pattern starts with a '.'), a regular expression
#           (pattern is enclosed in '/' characters), a full filename (anything
#           else).
#
# Notes on case-sensitivity:
#
# A suffix pattern is case-insensitive on Windows and case-sensitive
# elsewhere.  A filename pattern is case-sensitive everywhere. A regex
# pattern's case-sensitivity is defined by the regex. This means it is by
# default case-sensitive, but this can be changed using Python's inline
# regex option syntax. E.g.:
#         Makefile            /^(?i)makefile.*$/   # case-INsensitive regex
